# 🔒 Network-Ransomware (Wi-Fi Lock Prank)

![Screenshot](1.png)

This tool is used to demonstrate ransomware in a safe way (I have tried it on my own computer).  
Instead of locking files, it will lock the internet.  

`unlock.exe` will act as a decryption tool to unlock the internet.  

It can also be used as a joke prank.
